Name: Ranjith P
```

class Student:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.__name = name
        self.__age = age

    # Getter for age
    @property
    def age(self):
        return self.__age

    # Setter for age
    @age.setter
    def age(self, age):
        if age > 0 and isinstance(age, int):
            self.__age = age
        else:
            print("Please enter a valid age")

    # Method to print student details
    def print_details(self):
        return f"Name: {self.__name} {self.__age}"

# Create an instance
s = Student(" Jessa Salary:", 10000)
print(s.print_details())
# Change age using setter
s.age = 10000
print(s.print_details())



```
